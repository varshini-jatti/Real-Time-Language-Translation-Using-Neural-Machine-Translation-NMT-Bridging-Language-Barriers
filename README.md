# 🚀 Real-Time Language Translation with mT5  

A multilingual translation system using the mT5-base Transformer to break language barriers in real time.  

## 📌 Overview  
This project utilizes the mT5-base model from Hugging Face to translate text between English (en), Japanese (ja), and Chinese (zh). The model is fine-tuned on a multilingual dataset for high-accuracy translation.  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1️⃣ **Tokenization** – Input text is tokenized using the mT5 tokenizer.  
2️⃣ **Model Inference** – The tokenized text is processed through the mT5 model.  
3️⃣ **Decoding** – The generated tokens are converted into human-readable text.  

## 📊 Features  
✅ High-quality translation with mT5 Transformer  
✅ Supports English, Japanese, and Chinese  
✅ Beam Search for improved accuracy  
✅ GPU acceleration with CUDA  

## 🔹 Future Enhancements  
- Expand to more languages (e.g., Spanish, German)  
- Deploy as an API or web app  
This keeps it clear, professional, and to the point. Let me know if you need any tweaks! 🚀
